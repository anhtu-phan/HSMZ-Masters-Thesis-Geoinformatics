\chapter{Conclusion}

The results of this feasibility study support a recommendation for \textquote{single-use} or \textquote{ephemeral} development in cases where there is not a focus on commercial deployment and exploitation of services or products, but rather specialised tools that are an intrinsic part of smaller self-contained and short-lived projects.
In this case, a full-time developer could get the application up and running in about a month, with early practical experimentation beginning early on.
Additionally, the resulting reusable components could significantly accelerate future development, if roughly in the same area of usage.

Regarding the bulk of the application as transient and extracting the core functionality into well-documented and tested modules further has the benefit, that if the application is passed on to other developers for another project or task, they can decide to either go with the existing base infrastructure or to take only the core functionality and to implement it in their own favoured environment.
It would even enable them to more easily port the core to other languages. In the web development area, this is essential, because, while the standards and the application's feature set might stay the same, but the framework and tooling landscape certainly doesn't and even just a few years can render the application obsolete, if it is not constantly maintained.

As the funding schemes for most digital projects in niche culture or arts disciplines usually do not allocate that would allow for more than one or two developers to be included on the team.
Often the people working within these projects are not formally trained software engineers, but rather creative coders, hackers or engaging from a multidisciplinary angle where the technological aspects came as a secondary interest to a primary education in arts or other cultural fields.
This suggests to approach software development from a different angle and valuing the development process over the actual result.
While the objective always is to produce a function implementation in the end, it is less important to insist on clean code or engineering virtuosity such as scalability, maintainability and perfect abstraction.
It aims to \emph{decommodify the notion of an application} and to turn it into an ephemeral \emph{statement within a dialogue between engineering and artistic practice}.

We propose the term \emph{compostable software} to describe a cyclical development process that alternates between intuitive composition focused on loose experimentation and analytical decomposition using reflection and refactoring to extract essential structures emergent in the compositional process.
The extracted components can then become a \emph{substrate} for subsequent development processes, repeating the cycle and producing additional building blocks.
Here, the focus shifts from coding virtuosity and can help to lower the barrier between engineer and artist.
This should enable a more intertwined and participatory dialogue between the project's participants that is not just expressed in development meetings, but actual proposed hacks and modifications or additions, given the interest on behalf of all parties involved.

Compostable software development values \emph{processes over products} and embraces the \emph{ephemerality of contemporary digital technologies} as intrinsic design factors.
Thus, it should focus on constant reflection and re-evaluation of development results and being ready to potentially discarding everything but a seed for a fresh start, but keeping the knowledge and insights gained in the process alive through continuous inclusive, transdisciplinary dialogue and experimentation.
It positively values, what otherwise would negatively termed as \textquote{rot}, the result of a messy growth process in an amalgamation of engineering and artistic experimentation.

In general, this method of development can explicitly be recommended for experimental, non-commercial endeavours where factors like scale or long-term maintainability are secondary and where development should happen from within the actual practice as opposed to trying to communicate wishes and needs to external service providers.
